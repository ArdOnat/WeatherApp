# WeatherApp

An iOS application that allows users to view weather status at desirable locations.

In WeatherApp, I focused on Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles. (https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

I designed 4 different modules for having clean and scalable modules.

1 - [Core Module](https://github.com/ArdOnat/CoreModule) - (Yellow Layer of Uncle Bob's Architecture)
Module that keeps entities that will be used by multiple modules. In Clean Architecture principle, it is very important that these entities do not depend on any other moduoe.
